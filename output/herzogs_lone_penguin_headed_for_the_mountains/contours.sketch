# <title>Herzog's Lone Penguin Headed for the Mountains</title>
# <summary>
# A solitary penguin waddles across an expansive landscape toward distant
# mountain peaks, inspired by Werner Herzog's contemplative documentaries
# about nature's extremes and the absurd determination of creatures.
# The composition emphasizes isolation and scale.
