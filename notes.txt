--- STUDIO GOAL ---
i want to build a studio where a image description enters
and the artist inside that studio (an llm) iterates on
drafts, responds to critiques, and eventually produces a
final sketch in SketchLang. this will power the @sketchthis
project, to produce are entirely through the language model.


--- ARTIST ---
the artist is responsible for planning the steps, dividing
the work into sections, and managing thought processes which
recursively divide and conquer by adding details to the scene.
the artist decides what depth of detail is required. each
thought process must produce sketches for its delegated while
delegating coherency, through negotiation with its neighboring
tiles.

--- COMPILATION ---
we should verify that each piece produced by the thought
processes can reliably line up...


--- CRITIC ---
the critic is responsible for reviewing the art and giving feed
back, for specific sections. ill need to think more about how
this one operates and if the referenced sections need to
correspond to actual sections that were named by the artist.
