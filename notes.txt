--- STUDIO GOAL ---
i want to build a studio where a image description enters
and the artist inside that studio (an llm) iterates on
drafts, responds to critiques, and eventually produces a
final sketch in SketchLang. this will power the @sketchthis
project, to produce are entirely through the language model.


--- ARTIST ---
the artist is responsible for planning the steps, dividing
the work into sections, and managing thought processes which
recursively divide and conquer by adding details to the scene.
the artist decides what depth of detail is required. each
thought process must produce sketches for its delegated while
delegating coherency, through negotiation with its neighboring
tiles.

--- COMPILATION ---
we should verify that each piece produced by the thought
processes can reliably line up. *more thoughts below.

--- CRITIC ---
the critic is responsible for reviewing the art and giving feed
back, for specific sections. ill need to think more about how
this one operates and if the referenced sections need to
correspond to actual sections that were named by the artist.

--- TRANSPARENCY AND MONITORING ---
the studio will be written in golang. the process should be
transparent. for example logging of top level plans by the
artist, draft outputs (as svg), the critics responses. the
errors during compilation from Sketchlang compiler, the number
of tokens (is this possible) that the llm is using, and time
to complete each step.

--- PROMPT DESIGN ---
there are a few crucial prompts here that we want easy access
to. first the top level artist. this prompt must bring tell the
llm to create a detailed description of the image requested,
and then break the description into tiles for each recursive
sub-artist to approach. 

--- MERGING WORKS ---
merging the sub-artists works back together will take negotiation
between neighboring artists and will result in changes for the
artists to make. for example if one artist is working on the torso
of a main subject, while another is working on the arm and hand, the artists must communicate where that connection will take place.
also before merging we should try to compile the sub artist work
so we dont contaminate up.

--- PROMPTS ---
below is an example of how i will prompt the sub-artists that get
spawned from the original artists design.


```
I am providing you a language specification Sketchlang and a section of a sketch that needs to be reviewed and thoroughly detailed. I will provide some meta information about the sketch as a whole, but you are only concerned about reviewing and fixing up the drafted section. You can assume variables that are referenced are defined and can be used.

Here is the DSL <enter Lang Specification>
Here is the Sketch summary and meta info with the section in question: 
<sketch summary > + < section-inf>
```

--- KEEP IT SIMPLE ---
the original idea was to use many different entities. i
no longer think that is a good idea and will focus on keeping
it simple. first attempt to build the pipes to complete a
single pass through the sketch studio. this means we prompt
the llm to produce a detailed description, summary, and metadata
about an input image request along with a primary drafted
contour sketch containing the initial sections with corresponding
titles section descriptions.
we then compile that and keep results <title>_contours.svg for
viewing purposes. assuming that compilation passes we parse the
sketch summary, and sketch details, to create the Sketch type
which can be iterated on by sub-artists. this means each sub
artist will work on expanding their own section and adding meticulous
detail, while keeping in mind the metadata and larger picture idea.
we will top-to-bottom iterate. each iteration will produce some
expanded sketchlang output, which we will append into a file
<title>_expanded.sketch
we should compile that file after each iteration to make sure its
working as expected. we can save the compiled svg as
<title>_expanded_<section-title>.svg so that we can see the progress
we do this for all sections and finally produce the final!
